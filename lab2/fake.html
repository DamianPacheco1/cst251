	<h1>Digital Polaroids</h1>
</div>


<div class="desc">
<p>The Polaroid Corporation was founded by American scientist Edwin H. Land in 1937.
	The first Polaroid camera, called the Model 95, and its associated film went on sale in 1948 at a department store in Boston. It was a revolutionary that it transformed the photographic medium in ways that can still be seen today.
	Even if you haven’t adopted an analog process for creating photos, many of us enjoy applying filters to make our digital images look grainy,
	and as though they have vignettes or light leaks.</p>
</div>

<div class="desc2">
<p>Why are polaroids so popular today? Well the new generation thinks that polaroids are cool, just like the way they think vinyls are cool. People like the authentic and vintage feeling from polaroids. And the reason I choose this topic was because I liked the polaroid look from the pictures. Just like the way it looks and the vibes it kind of gives out.</p>
